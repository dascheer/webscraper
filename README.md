# What is the purpose?
The purpose of the webscraper is to extract all texts and their respective metadata from Medium for articles which fit the keyword and given time frame.

# Why is this relevant?
Medium (medium.com) is one of the world's leading websites for semi-academic articles. Therefore, it offers a wider breadth and actuality then scientific papers, where submissions often still have to be peer-reviewed and edited for up to two years before being published. Thus, many researchers prefer to use medium to get insights into current topics and less scientific articles. 

Due to its breath in Scope, it is sometimes difficult for researchers to read through all published articles for a given keyword in a given timeframe. Thus, to better understand the research streams and focus areas for a given keyword, researchers often follow a keyword clustering and counting approach, in which researchers count how often important keywords exist and what their relationship is. To be able to follow this approach and filter for specific keywords, the text of all articles and their respective metadata need to be downloaded. Our webscraper can be used to speed up this process, as it eliminates the manual effort of downloading all papers. If executed correctly, the code adds all texts and metadata which are published on medium for a given keyword in a given timeframe into one file. This file can then be used for further analysis as depicted above.
